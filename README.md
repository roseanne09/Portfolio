Portfolio
Just a small online presence.

Hey there! I've built a small portfolio website, but please don't copy it. Instead, challenge yourself to make a better one.

Please note that I've left some photo sections blank as I wasn't sure what to put in there.

Creating this portfolio took me some time, as web development isn't my area of expertise. However, I don't regret it one bit.

Please feel free to proofread my website and provide any suggestions to improve it. Thank you!
